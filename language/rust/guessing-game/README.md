# Guessing Game

This is a _simple_ guessing game from The Rust Programming Language book at
chapter two. The goal is to try some Rust code.

This is not really the same with the book since I'm implemented it on my own.
Well, not really useful.

## Instruction

Run `cargo run` command to play the game. Input a number and see whether the
answer is right or not. The program count your steps. If you want to quit,
just write `exit` then hit ENTER on the keyboard.
